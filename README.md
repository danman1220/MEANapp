Practice on MEANjs


This is a project to eventually help take care of character info for Dungeons and Dragons
Really, its just a pet project: don't expect too much from me :P
you need:

node

mongodb

bower (npm install -g bower)

then, once you have it

-in the project directory, run npm install

-in the project directory, run bower install

to start the app, first start up mongodb with the mongod command
then, in the project directory, run npm start or grunt for dev
the app will be on localhost:5309 (adding 867 later)
